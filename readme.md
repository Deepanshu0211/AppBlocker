# App Blocker

App Blocker is a simple Python application built using Tkinter that allows users to block specific applications on their system and replace them with alternative applications. It provides a GUI interface for selecting applications to block and their replacement applications.

## Features

- Select applications to block and their replacement applications.
- Start and stop blocking of selected applications.
- View a list of currently blocked applications.
- Load and display a GIF animation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- psutil
- Pillow (PIL)
- requests

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
3. Run the `app_blocker.py` file using Python.

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `app_blocker.py`.
2. Use the GUI interface to add applications to block and their replacement applications.
3. Start blocking to prevent the execution of selected applications.
4. Stop blocking to allow the execution of applications again.
5. Clear the list to remove all blocked applications.
6. Enjoy the GIF animation while using the application.
